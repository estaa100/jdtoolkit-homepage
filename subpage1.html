		<p>This is my logo, which I created using Adobe Illustrator. It was quite hard to settle on something that I found aesthetically pleasing that also represented me. I thought that nothing could be more representative of me than my name, which is why I chose to base my logo around it.

		<p>First, I used the circle tool to create the circle that surrounds the letter A. I then drew the letter A using the paintbrush tool in the color black. I also played around with the color palette to get the sage green inside the circle, then I filled that circle with the new color. Finally, I typed out my name and wrapped the text over the shape to create the finished logo you see above.  </p>
