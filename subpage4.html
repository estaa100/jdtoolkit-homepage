		<p>This is a video I recorded on Wednesday, April 8, 2020 at 7:00pm. Although the faces of supporters are unclear, the applause and cheers for the workers at the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic are resounding.
			 There have been countless videos of similar instances around the world, especially in Manhattan, where sounds of support for healthcare workers can be heard. My neighbors here in Queens only recently began expressing their support, as well. Here are some recent articles that touch more on the subject:
